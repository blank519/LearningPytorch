This repository simply contains all the files I have used while experimenting with PyTorch.  
  
Most of the files are from me testing stuff out from the PyTorch tutorial.  
  
The "project_with_pytorch.py" file comes from using PyTorch to rebuild a project from my Machine Learning class using Pytorch. Data is unavailable for academic integrity.
